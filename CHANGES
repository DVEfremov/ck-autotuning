* 2015.09.02 FGG: * turning off 'state check' (frequency change during experiments) by default
                    in autotuning demos

* 2015.09.01 FGG: * adding timeout for program compilation and execution
                    (useful for research in computer engineering where
                    generated code may be buggy and result in infinite loops,
                    i.e. during autotuning or compiler testing and bug detection)
                  * providing more info about compilation and execution failures
                  * adding possibility to record only failed cases
                    (useful to crowdsource testing compilers/programs/os/architecture for bugs)

* 2015.08.12 FGG: * adding 'auto' tag to identify/detect automatically extracted compiler descriptions
                  * adding parsing of reserved key $#ck_take_from_{CID}$# - for example, used to calculate accuracy for autotuning in slambench
                  * adding possibility to reverse key order in Pareto frontier filter during multi-objective autotuning 
                    (useful for FPS in slambench, for example)

* 2015.08.11 FGG: * showing compiler flags in HTML (when viewing entries)
                  * fixing some wrong compiler flag descriptions

* 2015.08.10 FGG: * added GCC 5.2.0 CK package (will be downloaded and installed)

* 2015.08.09 FGG: * add extra dict when recording experiments (useful to record name and subview_uoa, for example)
                  * fixing a few bugs in experiment viewing
