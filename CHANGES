* 2015.08.12 FGG: * adding 'auto' tag to identify/detect automatically extracted compiler descriptions
                  * adding parsing of reserved key $#ck_take_from_{CID}$# - for example, used to calculate accuracy for autotuning in slambench
                  * adding possibility to reverse key order in Pareto frontier filter during multi-objective autotuning 
                    (useful for FPS in slambench, for example)
* 2015.08.11 FGG: * showing compiler flags in HTML (when viewing entries)
                  * fixing some wrong compiler flag descriptions
* 2015.08.10 FGG: * added GCC 5.2.0 CK package (will be downloaded and installed)
* 2015.08.09 FGG: * add extra dict when recording experiments (useful to record name and subview_uoa, for example)
                  * fixing a few bugs in experiment viewing
