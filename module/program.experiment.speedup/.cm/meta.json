  "full_desc": "Experiment: check program speedups vs a few combinations of compiler flags and several data sets\n\nAuthor: Grigori Fursin (Grigori.Fursin@cTuning.org)\n\nIdea: I started related and ad-hoc experiments around 1993 when optimizing simulation of my semiconductor neural networks on supercomputers in terms of performance, energy and size. Since then I spent many years developing various machine learning based autotuning techniques. At the end, I decided to unify such experimentation.\n\nFirst public version: I developed related plugin for my plugin-based autotuning and crowd-tuning cTuning framework around 2007 for the MILEPOST project (where I developed practical machine-learning based compiler).",
