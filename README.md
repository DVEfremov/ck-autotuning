Description
===========

This is a heavily evolving repository 
(stable release is expected in Spring 2015) - 
please, do not use it until official announcement.

We are gradually moving, simplifying and extending parts
of functionality from Collective Mind in to new CK format!

These modules will be used to:
* clean, compile and run programs 
* perform benchmarking
* perform plugin-based auto-tuning
* perform crowd-tuning
* perform statistical analysis
* gradually add reproducibility of results
