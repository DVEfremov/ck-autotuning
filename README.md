Description
===========
We are gradually moving, simplifying and extending auto-tuning
from Collective Mind into new CK format! Since design and optimization
spaces are very large, we are trying to make their exploration practical 
and scalable by combining auto-tuning, crowdsourcing, predictive 
analytics and run-time adaptation.

Modules from this repository will be used to:
* clean, compile and run programs 
* perform benchmarking
* perform plugin-based auto-tuning
* perform crowd-tuning
* perform statistical analysis
* gradually add reproducibility of results
